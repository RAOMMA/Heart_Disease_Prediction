# Heart Disease Prediction with Streamlit

This Streamlit web application is designed to predict whether an individual is likely to have heart disease or not based on certain health-related features. It utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model to make predictions.

## Dataset

- **Dataset Name**: Heart Disease dataset
- **Data Source**: [Provide information on where the dataset can be obtained]
- The dataset contains the following attributes:
  - Feature columns (13): Various health-related features such as age, sex, chest pain type, etc.
  - Target column: Binary variable (0 for no heart disease, 1 for heart disease).

## Project Structure

- **README.md**: Documentation of the project.
- **main.py**: Streamlit web application script for making heart disease predictions.
- **model.joblib**: Pre-trained machine learning model for heart disease prediction.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd heart-disease-prediction

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended) and install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate

## Usage
`Clone this repository to your local machine.
`Ensure you have the pre-trained machine learning model ('model.joblib') in the same directory as the script ('main.py').
`Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
`Run the Streamlit app:

 ## For example:
    ``` streamlit run main.py

Visit the provided URL in your web browser to interact with the application. Follow the instructions in the web interface to input the required features for prediction.

## Model Training
The project uses a machine learning model to classify individuals into two classes: heart disease and no heart disease. The pre-trained model is saved as 'model.joblib'.

## Evaluation
The Streamlit web application provides binary predictions. You can evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
The project provides predictions for heart disease based on the input features. The performance of the model may vary depending on the dataset used.

## Future Improvements
There are several ways to improve the model and the project:

-Explore more advanced machine learning techniques.

-Fine-tune hyperparameters for better model performance.

-Gather more labeled data for improved accuracy.
